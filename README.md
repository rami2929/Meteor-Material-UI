Meteor Material UI
==================

A CSS Framework and a Set of Blaze UI Components that Implement Google's Material Design for Meteor

## History:
This is a port from material-ui (https://github.com/callemall/material-ui), which currently supports React for the UI components, and LESS for styles.

This repository's goal is to port that repository for Meteor,  replacing LESS with SASS, and React with Blaze, so it's fully Meteorized :)
